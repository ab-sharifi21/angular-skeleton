## ℹ️ About

The main goal of this project is to provide a base template for the generation of a production-ready web application made with `Angular`. The idea is to avoid having to configure all the tools involved in a project every time it is started and thus be able to focus on the definition and implementation of the business logic.

> 📣 This is an opinionated template. The architecture of the code base and the configuration of the different tools used has been based on best practices and personal preferences.

### 🚀 Quick start

- Start project in development mode:

  ```bash
  npm run start:dev
